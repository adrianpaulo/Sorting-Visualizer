How to compile: 
To run I used a pycharm ide in order to compile the python files. 
To run in the terminal: $ python file_name.py

Project Summary: 

* Each algorithm is in its own file away from the others. The name of the files correspond to the sorting algorithm within the file. 

* I used matplotlib to plot my graphs. 

* For the algorithms, Insertion sort, Radix sort and Bucket sort, they only have 7 different samples of length N compared to the total 11 samples. All of the following algorithms are able to compile, however, they were slower than the other algorithms, thus for the reasoning behind the lessened number of samples.
